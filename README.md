Do you pine[^1] for the nice days of Minix 1.1, when men were men and wrote their  
own device drivers? Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth  
on a OS you can try to modify for your needs? Are you finding it frustrating when  
everything works on your OS? No more all-nighters to get a nifty program working?  
Then this post might be just for you.  
Torvalds, L.
